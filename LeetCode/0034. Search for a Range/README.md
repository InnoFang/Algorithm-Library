Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of _O_(log _n_).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

For example, <br/>
Given `[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]` and target value 8, <br/>
return `[3, 4]`. <br/>
