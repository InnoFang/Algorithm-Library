Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7

return its level order traversal as:

    [
      [3],
      [9,20],
      [15,7]
    ]
