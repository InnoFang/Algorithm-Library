Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,

`"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` is a palindrome.

`"race a car"` is not a palindrome.

**Note:**

Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
