Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (the **letter** O), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

For example,

    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X

After running your function, the board should be:

    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X
