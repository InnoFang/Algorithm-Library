Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a **palindrome**. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A **palindrome** string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```Â 

**Constraints:**

 + `1 <= s.length <= 16`
 + `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
