Given two strings _**s**_ and _**t**_, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in _**s**_ can be replaced to get _**t**_.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,

Given `"egg"`, `"add"`, return true.

Given `"foo"`, `"bar"`, return false.

Given `"paper"`, `"title"`, return true.

**Note:**

You may assume both _**s**_ and _**t**_ have the same length.
