Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1**

> **Input:** [3, 0, 1]
>
> **Output:** 2


**Example 2**

> **Input:** [9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1]
>
> **Output:** 8

**Note:**

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
