Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`, after calling your function, `nums` should be `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`.


**Note:**

 1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
 2. Minimize the total number of operations.
