Given an array nums containing _n_ + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and _n_ (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

 1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
 2. You must use only constant, _O_(1) extra space.
 3. Your runtime complexity should be less than _O_(n^2).
 4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
