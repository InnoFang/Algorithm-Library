Given a non-empty array of integers, return the ***k*** most frequent elements.

For example,

Given `[1,1,1,2,2,3]` and k = 2, return `[1,2]`.

**Note:**

 + You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
 + Your algorithm's time complexity **must be** better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
