Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1**:

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    Output: [2]

**Example 2**:

    Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
    Output: [9,4]

**Note**:

 + Each element in the result must be unique.
 + The result can be in any order.
