Given a string `s`Â that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

**Note:**

Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```
