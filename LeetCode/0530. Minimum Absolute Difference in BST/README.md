Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum [absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference) between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**

    Input:

       1
        \
         3
        /
       2

    Output:
    1

    Explanation:
    The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).

**Note:** There are at least two nodes in this BST.
