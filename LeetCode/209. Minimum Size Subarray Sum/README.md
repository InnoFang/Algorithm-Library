Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s**, find the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum â‰¥ **s**. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array `[2,3,1,2,4,3]` and `s = 7`,

the subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
