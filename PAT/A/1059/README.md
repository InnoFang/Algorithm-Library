# [1059 Prime Factors](https://pintia.cn/problem-sets/994805342720868352/problems/994805415005503488)

Given any positive integer **N**, you are supposed to find all of its prime factors, and write them in the format `N = p1^k1 x p2^k2 x ... x pm^km`

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer ***N*** in the range of **long int**.

## Output Specification:

Factor ***N*** in the format `N = p1^k1 x p2^k2 x ... x pm^km`, where `pi`​​'s are prime factors of N in increasing order, and the exponent `k​i`​​ is the number of `p​i`​​ -- hence when there is only one `pi`, `ki`​ is 1 and must **NOT** be printed out.

## Sample Input:

```
97532468
```

## Sample Output:

```
97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291
```
