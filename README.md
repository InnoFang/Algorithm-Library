# Oh, my algorithms
 
 Collecting my various algorithm practices, covering a variety of programming languages that I have learned and are learning.

## [algo-java-kt](https://github.com/InnoFang/oh-my-algorithms/tree/master/algo-java-kt)

 Using Java and Kotlin to implement some algorithm. For me, more is to think about how to achieve an algorithm library, but it's just a beginner's try.

## [ds-cpp](https://github.com/InnoFang/oh-my-algorithms/tree/master/ds-cpp)

Using C++ to implement various data structures in the book named Data Structure written by Yan Weiming and produced by Tsinghua University press.

## [codewars](https://github.com/InnoFang/oh-my-algorithms/tree/master/codewars/)

Used to increase the skill and proficiency of programming languages. Mainly  programming language is Python rigth now.

## [leetcode](https://github.com/InnoFang/oh-my-algorithms/tree/master/leetcode)

Use a variety of programming languages to solve problems, learn how to use skills and problem solving ideas. Mainly is Kotlin.
