Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have _**exactly**_ one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

> Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
> Because nums[**0**] + nums[**1**] = 2 + 7 = 9,
> return [**0, 1**].
