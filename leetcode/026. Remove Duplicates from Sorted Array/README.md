Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

**Example:**

    Given nums = [1,1,2],

    Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
    It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
