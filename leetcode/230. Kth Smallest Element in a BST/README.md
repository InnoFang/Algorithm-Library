Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:**

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**

What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
