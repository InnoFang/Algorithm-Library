Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

For example:

Given `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]`, return `[3, 5]`.

**Note:**

 1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
 2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
