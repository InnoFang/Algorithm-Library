## Run command

```shell
python main.py < in.txt > out.txt
type out.txt
```

If you want to write the output to `out.txt` , but also displayed on the screen, you can use the following command (shell on Linux or Powershell on Windows):

```shell
python main.py < in.txt | tee out.txt
```

For `bat` scripts on Windows, you can use the following alternatives:

```shell
python main.py < in.txt > out.txt
type out.txt
pause
```
